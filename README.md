# What is it

This is a Python package used to demonstrate library-level instrumentation with `opentelemetry`.
The package is built by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

The [`fake-app`](https://github.com/everdark/fake-app) contains the application code with `opentelemetry` implementation to test out the actual traces and metrics at application level.
